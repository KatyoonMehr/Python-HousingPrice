## Python-HousingPrice
# Abstract:
There are some features affected the Housing price. It can be the size of the house such as number of rooms and bathrooms, 
location and so on. The purpose of this study is to find the best model, using Linear regression, KNN, Adaboost, Random 
Forest and SVR, to find out what are the features affecting the housing price.

# Methods:
linear regression, KNN, adaboost, random forest, SVR 

#Conclusion: 
Linear Regression is not a good model to predict the dependent variable y because the R-Square is very low. 
Perhaps there are more important features in the housing price which we have not seen in this model. Between 
KNN, Adaboost, SVR and Random Forest, the latter one by using 1000 estimators has the highest value for 
accuracy with 73%.
